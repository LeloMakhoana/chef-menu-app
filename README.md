I made major revisions and enhancements to this project in response to Part 2 comments and Part 3 needs. To simplify state management, I first redesigned the Menu Context by giving the Menu Item type a clear structure and ensuring that every item has the necessary characteristics, including ID, course, price, and URI. The app's data consistency was enhanced by this modification.
To improve maintainability, I also restructured the application by dividing the code into more manageable, reusable parts. I introduced a new price input box to the AddMenuScreen, enabling the addition of menu items with a price value. To ensure smooth interaction with other app features, the screen now adds items using the revised Menu Context methods.
To determine and show the average costs of menu items grouped by course, the Average Price component was updated. To support the modified Menu Item structure, which now includes the price field, the logic needed to be fixed.
These modifications guarantee that the application is complete, easy to use, and prepared for submission. Every update is detailed in the changelog and illustrated in the video tour that goes with it.
